2. Double-click to Run the Agent Program and Set the IP and Port of the Server

   The program interface defaults to being minimized to the tray. If it appears as ![1669363457455](Agent.assets/1669363457455.jpg), it indicates that the current Agent is not connected to the Server, and you need to configure the IP and port of the Server. Right-click the ![1669363457455](Agent.assets/1669363457455.jpg) icon and select "Configuration". Complete the configuration in the pop-up window, as shown below.
