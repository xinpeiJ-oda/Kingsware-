## RPA and AI

The future development of RPA technology cannot be separated from the currently hottest technology, artificial intelligence (AI). RPA and AI technologies are highly complementary, akin to the relationship between the brain and muscles in the human body. Unlike RPA technology, which enables robots to handle "single, repetitive, and standardized processes," AI can understand organizational decisions and use statistical analysis to formulate rules around these decisions, thereby addressing more complex business environments. If RPA is the neural network of the robot, then AI is the brain of the robot. By empowering RPA technology with AI, the capabilities of RPA can be greatly enhanced.

Currently, the combination of RPA with some basic AI technologies has achieved positive results, including the integration of OCR image recognition, facial recognition, document recognition, and invoice recognition technologies, to enhance more business operation processes. In the future, deeper artificial intelligence technologies, including big data analysis and the use of deep machine learning algorithms, will be integrated. These technologies can build knowledge bases from historical data and use them for behavior decision-making and prediction. Combining with machine learning, the potential for cost savings and efficiency improvements is limitless.
