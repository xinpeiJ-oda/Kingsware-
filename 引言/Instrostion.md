Besides the robots mentioned above, more robots can be custom-developed based on business needs. RPA brings "robotic labor" into traditional organizational structures, executing and enhancing business workflows, improving work efficiency, accelerating value realization, and reducing human errors. It represents the technological crystallization of automation technology development and is an inevitable product of the Industry 4.0 era.
