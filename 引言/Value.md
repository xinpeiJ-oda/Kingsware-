## Value of RPA Implementation

RPA robots have gained increasing favor mainly because RPA can transfer **large, repetitive, and time-consuming** tasks to "robots," thus freeing employees from tedious work. This allows employees to leverage their initiative and perform tasks of higher value. Compared to employees, RPA robots can execute tasks more **quickly and accurately**, and robots can work tirelessly, **24/7**, to perform the necessary tasks.
