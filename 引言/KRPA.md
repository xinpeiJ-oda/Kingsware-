## Kingsware K-RPA

The Kingsware RPA system (referred to as "**K-RPA**") consists of three program parts: Server, Control, and Robot (also known as Agent). The overall architecture adopts a three-tier structure and supports both C/S and B/S modes. The system's core engine is developed using the efficient C++ language, focusing on low energy consumption for resource overhead. Based on an atomized and componentized design concept, the system ensures the reusability and flexibility of its technical architecture.

The system follows the green software concept, requiring no installation process; a single file can be copied directly for use, making deployment convenient, fast, and simple, and supporting batch upgrades. The K-RPA product architecture is shown in the figure below. ![image-20220509144555507](KRPA.assets/image-20220509144555507.png)

- Robot application (i.e., robot agent), installed on the target machine where operations are executed, is the program that performs automated operations on the target machine, including installing the agent on physical or virtual machines. It can execute different tasks at scheduled times and is responsible for specific process operations tasks, serving as a 24/7 virtual employee.
- Server application (i.e., RPA controller), used to coordinate, connect, and manage robots and Control, while centrally storing and managing all system resources (including process, script, user permission information, etc.). The Server limits the total number of simultaneous connections from Control and Robot.
- Control application (i.e., robot editing and design end), used for user interaction with the robot. This application allows for the development of scenario scripts, process configuration, process management, process triggering, robot operation management, and system configuration. The Control end can only perform process definition and robot control tasks when connected to the Server.
