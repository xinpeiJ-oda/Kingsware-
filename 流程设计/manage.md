## Managing Process Robots

If you need to view or operate the process from the console of another machine while it is running, you can use the process takeover feature to bring the process over.

Process takeover can be done in the "Process Takeover" interface, where you can view processes that you have permission for.

The scenarios for the "Process Takeover" interface include: reviewing processes currently being executed in task configuration, reviewing processes that failed to execute in task configuration, and temporarily taking over processes currently being executed by other personnel.
