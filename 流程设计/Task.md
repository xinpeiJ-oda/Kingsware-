### Task Configuration

In the [Running the Process](\流程设计\Function.md) section, the process execution operation is performed manually. However, we can also set up automatic tasks to allow processes to execute automatically. The specific steps are as follows:

1. Enter the 【Task Configuration】 interface to configure automatic tasks.

3. After configuration, the robot will automatically execute under the set conditions, and you can see the scheduled trigger record of the task under the day's tasks.
