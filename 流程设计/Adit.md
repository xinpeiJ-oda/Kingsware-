> - <font color="black">Add Node: In the process editing interface, click the node you want to add in the process node bar on the right side (the selected node's font will turn green). Move the mouse to a blank area in the process editing interface and click to add the node.</font>
> - <font color="black">Delete Node or Connection: Select the node you want to delete with the mouse and press the "Delete" key to delete the node.</font>
> - <font color="black">Node Connection: In the process node bar on the right side of the interface, check "Connection Line." Move the mouse to the node in the editing area, click the added node, hold the mouse and drag to another node, then release the mouse to complete the connection.</font>

After adding the process, a process template consisting of a start node, end node, and component node will be automatically generated. We can edit based on this process.

This section introduces the component node as an example.

   If there is an "*" symbol next to the process name, it indicates that the process has not been saved and needs to be saved first.
