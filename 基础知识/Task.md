## Tasks

### What is a Task

Users can configure different types of automated tasks based on their needs, such as system tasks, process tasks, report tasks, agile tasks, etc. System tasks can only be viewed by administrators. Automated tasks can be configured to trigger and execute daily, weekly, monthly, once, every minute/hour, on server startup, on user login, or specific events. Additionally, tasks scheduled for the day will be displayed on the [Task Delay] interface. If you need to extend the start time of a process task, you can perform a delay operation on the [Task Delay] interface. The execution time of the task after the change will be based on the modified time, and the change is only valid once.

### Task Configuration

The steps to create an automated task are as follows:

1. Enter the [Task Configuration] menu

   In the left menu bar of the interface, click [Task Management], then click [Task Configuration] on the page to enter the task configuration interface.
