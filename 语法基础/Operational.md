## Operators

Operators are symbols that perform various operations between data. Common operators include arithmetic operators, comparison operators, and logical operators.

### Arithmetic Operators

Used to perform basic mathematical operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

| Operator | Meaning       | Example  |
| -------- | ------------- | -------- |
| +        | Addition      | X + Y    |
| -        | Subtraction   | X - Y    |
| *        | Multiplication| X * Y    |
| /        | Division      | X / Y    |
| Div      | Integer Division | X Div Y |
| Mod      | Modulus       | X Mod Y  |

### Comparison Operators

| Operator | Meaning       | Example  |
| -------- | ------------- | -------- |
| >        | Greater Than  | X > Y    |
| <        | Less Than     | X < Y    |
| >=       | Greater Than or Equal To | X >= Y |
| <=       | Less Than or Equal To | X <= Y |
| <>       | Not Equal To  | X <> Y   |

### Logical Operators

| Operator | Meaning | Example              |
| -------- | ------- | -------------------- |
| And      | AND     | (X > 1) and (Y > 1)  |
| Or       | OR      | (X > 1) or (Y > 1)   |
| Not      | NOT     | Not (X = 0)          |
